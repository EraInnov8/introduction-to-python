# Who are you?

You are Taylor. You never learnt how to program. You want to learn how to program.
**Welcome to Python.**

You are Maria. You know how to program. Or rather, you KNEW how to program. You last programmed more than a decade ago, which is ages in technology terms. You want to get a headstart in programming.
**Welcome to Python.**

Or, you are Abigail. You want to dive deep into programming. You want to explore the worlds of AI and ML. You are looking for a programming language that gets you there in the shortest time.

Back in the day, Liem started a coffee shop - Dusk Coffee in Hanoi, Vietnam. Not getting any customers in the early days, he decided to promote his coffee shop. He noticed in the evenings, office workers arrived at the bus station. So everyday, at 6pm he started promoting Dusk Coffee and shared his business cards. Gradually, customers started to visit him and before leaving, they even posted a sticky note of their experience. Reading about the customer experience on Dusk Coffee's wall and by the promotion from the business cards, more customers started visiting Duk Coffee.
In the next four months, Dusk Coffee had several returning customers. As the clock hit 6pm, customers from the bus stop rushed to grab a cup of coffee at Liem's coffee shop, even waiting up to 30 minutes outside the shop to order takeaway.
Seeing his business grow, Liem envisions Dusk Coffee to expand beyond the local bus station of Hanoi. He doesn't want to distribute business cards again and has limited knowledge on how he can leverage technology to reach beyond the local bus station. With growing customers day by day, Liem has a mountain of customer data but doesn't know how to use it to build a loyal customer base and increase his sales. He also needs to find ways to engage with customers beyond the physical coffee shop.
To find solutions to his problems, Liem hires a tech firm - Novum Solutions and shares his vision for Liem Dusk Coffee.

# What is [Python](https://www.python.org/)?

We engineers are problem solvers. At it's core, python is nothing but a tool for problem solving. As a part of the engineering team of Novum Solutions, we decide that **Python** programming language can solve most of the problem Liem is facing today.
Why did we choose Python? This is because solutions implemented in Python are faster and are in high demand currently. Learning curve is relatively low and the skills and concepts you learn here are easily transferable and applicable to other programming languages.

Here are some of the ways we can use Python to transform Liem's vision into reality.

1. Web Development - Dusk Coffee's first website creates a digital presence that works 24/7. Now instead of paper business cards, customers discover Dusk Coffee on Google searches.
2. Data Science and Analysis - Using the mountains of sales receipts we can transform three months of paper receipts into insights like - 75% of customers arrive between 6-7 PM or identify Vietnamese Iced Coffee the signature drink for Dusk Coffee.
3. Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence - Can predict tomorrow's customer volume with 85% accuracy and send alerts to Liem like - Tomorrow expects 150 customers, prepare 3kg extra beans.
4. Web Scraping - Analyzed nearby coffee shop reviews to understand what customers value, how much are they willing to pay across Hanoi and find neighborhoods with high office worker density.
5. Desktop Applications - Queue management that shows wait times on a display or end-of-day automatic report generation for existing supplies.

## Where else is Python is used?

1. Google uses Python for internal systems.
2. Netflix uses Python for its recommendation algorithms.
3. Instagram is built using Python.
4. NASA uses Python for scientific computing.
5. Spotify uses Python for data analysis.

## What next?

If you were an engineer at Novum Solutions, how would you have proceeded? What code would you write? Where would you write it? How would you write it? In the next lesson we will answer these questions.
