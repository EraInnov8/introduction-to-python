Getting Started with Python: A Beginner's Guide

# What is [Python](https://www.python.org/)?

Python is an interpreted programming language that widely used in many domains. It is one of the tools in the programming toolkit that can help you solve a problem.
For example:

1. Web Development - Frameworks like Django, Flask.
2. Data Science and Analysis - Libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.
3. Machine Learning and AI - TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn.
4. Web Scraping - Tools like BeautifulSoup, Scrapy.
5. Desktop Applications - GUI frameworks like Tkinter, PyQt.

## What are frameworks and libraries?

Frameworks and libraries are pre-written building blocks that provide structure to build an application efficiently. They take care of what happens behind the scenes so that you as a developer can focus on solving the actual problem at hand.

1. **Frameworks** - are like an umbrella under which an application is build and executed on. For example: Django, Flask, Pyramid, and Scrapy are some popular Python frameworks.
2. **Libraries** - are used to perform a specific task like reading, writing updating or visualizing data, requesting resources from a server to name a few. For example: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Requests, and BeautifulSoup are some popular Python frameworks.

# Why Python?

Python has a high demand in the tech industry. Learning curve is relatively low and the skills and concepts you learn are transferable and applicable to other programming languages.

## Where Python is used?

1. Google uses Python for internal systems.
2. Netflix uses Python for its recommendation algorithms.
3. Instagram is built using Python.
4. NASA uses Python for scientific computing.
5. Spotify uses Python for data analysis.
