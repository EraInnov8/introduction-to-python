# Control Structures

Control structures determine the flow of a program's execution. It allows a program to make decisions, repeat tasks, and skip or jump to specific sections of code. In python, we have four types of control Structures.

1. **Sequential Structure** - is the default structure a program follows, sequentially - one after another.
2. **Conditional Statements** - make decisions based on conditions. If a given condition is true (for example user authentication, giving an option of a $50 discount coupon if purchase total amount in shopping cart is $999 or more), a specific block of code is executed.
3. **Loops** - are used to repeat a block of code multiple times. For example sending an email to every subscriber of a database or reading/ writing data from database.
4. **Jump Statements** - transfer control to a different part of the program. For example when searching a database, when the `target_record` is found, we can jump to the next steps.
