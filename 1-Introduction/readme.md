# How to get started with Python?

## Welcome to Python Development!

Before we get started, keep in mind.

1. The following guidance provides one of many ways to get started with Python. Please feel free to explore different approaches and resources. That is how you will learn.
2. If you encounter an error, please read the error and refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.co/) or Google it. There are high chances that if you are encountering an error, someone else would have too and posted a solution.
3. As a developer, you are entering a supportive and collaborative ecosystem. Don't hesitate to ask questions, share knowledge, and learn from others.

## Getting started with python in two steps.

1. Installing python on your operating system.

   1. **Windows**
      1. Go to [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version for Windows.
      2. Open the downloaded `.exe` file and follow the installation wizard.
      3. To verify installation `python --version`
   2. **Mac or Linux**
      1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
      2. Open Terminal and use the command `brew install python`
      3. To verify installation `python3 --version`

2. Installing an IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
   1. For this course, we will use Visual Studio Code. Visit [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and choose the type of installer based on the type of your operating system. Fow Windows - `.exe` file, macOS - `.dmg` file and Linux - `.deb`. Download the file and follow the installation wizard.
   2. Open VS Code. Click on the Extensions icon in the left sidebar and Search for Python in the Extensions Marketplace. Install the **Python extension by Microsoft**. It provides features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging that will be helpful when we write code.
