## Welcome to Introduction to Python Development!

Have you ever seen a chemistry laboratory?

Imagine. A researcher adds two chemicals together. At 20°C, they create a life-saving medicine. At 22°C, they produce a toxic compound. This razor-thin margin is why chemistry laboratories operate under strict environmental control. Without this precision, a scientific experiment becomes guesswork. A safe reaction could turn explosive. A cancer treatment discovery today might be impossible to recreate tomorrow.

Just as a researcher require a controlled laboratory, software developers need their own precision environment - the Integrated Development Environment (IDE). These digital workspaces are build by technology companies for software developers like us. These specialized IDEs have the tools, features, and controls necessary for specific programming needs. For example -

1. [Jetbrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/)
   1. [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) - For Java and Kotlin development.
   2. [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - Dedicated IDE for Python - with scientific tools and framework support.
2. Microsoft
   1. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (2015) - Revolutionized the IDE ecosystem with its lightweight design and support for many [programming languages](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/overview). It is the world's most popular IDE.
3. The Next-Generation of IDEs
   The IDEs integrate artificial intelligence to predict/ improve existing code, suggest improvements, and accelerate development for all major programming languages.

## Getting started with python in two steps.

Setting up the environment for python development requires two steps.

1. Installing python on your operating system.

   1. **Windows**
      1. Go to [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version for Windows.
      2. Open the downloaded `.exe` file and follow the installation wizard.
      3. To verify installation `python --version`
   2. **Mac or Linux**
      1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
      2. Open Terminal and use the command `brew install python`
      3. To verify installation `python3 --version`

2. Installing an IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
   1. For this course, we will use Visual Studio Code. Visit [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and choose the type of installer based on the type of your operating system. Fow Windows - `.exe` file, macOS - `.dmg` file and Linux - `.deb`. Download the file and follow the installation wizard.
   2. Open VS Code. Click on the Extensions icon in the left sidebar and Search for Python in the Extensions Marketplace. Install the **Python extension by Microsoft**. It provides features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging that will be helpful when we write code.

Now that the environment is set up, let us write our first line of code.
