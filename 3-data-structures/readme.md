# Data Structures

## Data Types

Data type is the kind of data stored in a variable or data structure. Despite being dynamically typed, every value in Python has a data type associated with it. The basic data types are -

1. `int`- Integer numbers
2. `float`- Floating-point numbers
3. `complex`- Complex numbers
4. `str`- Strings and characters
5. `bytes`, `bytearray`- Bytes
6. `bool`- Boolean values

The most essential data types in Python can be categorized as numeric, sequence, binary, and Boolean.

## Structures

Data structures are used to store and organize data in an efficient way to access, modify, and manipulate. Python provides several built-in data structures, that suits to various tasks and data requirements. The most common and widely used data structures are -

1. **List** - an ordered, mutable (can be changed) collection that contains different types of items. For example a shopping list.
2. **Tuple** - an ordered, immutable collection (can not be changed) collection of items. For example RGB color, latitude and longitude of a geographical location.
3. **Dictionary** - a collection of key-value pairs. Here each key is unique. For example an address book.
4. **Set** - an unordered collection of unique items. For example keeping a track of unique participants in an event.
